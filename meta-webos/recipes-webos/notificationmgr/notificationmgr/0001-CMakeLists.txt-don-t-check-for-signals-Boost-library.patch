Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: don't check for signals Boost library

deprecated signals library was dropped in 1.69.0 release:
https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_69_0.html

Signals (v1) is now removed. Its removal was announced in 1.68 and its deprecation was announced in 1.54. Boost 1.68 is the last release that provides this library. Users are encouraged to use Signals2 instead. The Boost community thanks Douglas Gregor for his work on Signals which served its users well and which also inspired Signals2.

This component is already using Signals2 so just drop the check for old
unused component.
